# What does it do?
You create `{{[[video]]: https://youtu.be/46A01oukux0?t=20&end=100 }}` blocks, note the `t=` and `end=`, though you can add playback speed also with `s=` up to `2`.
Simple as that, create as many "Youtube Gifs" and start to visualize some ideas.

### JS
Under a block with the component `{{{[[roam/js]]}}}`, the javascript code will live inside a ```javascript ``` code block.
