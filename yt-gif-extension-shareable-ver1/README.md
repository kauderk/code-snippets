# What does it do?
Loops videos between the `start` and `end` youtube url parameters.
You create some `{{[[video]]: https://youtu.be/46A01oukux0?t=20&end=100 }}` blocks, note the `t=` and `end=`, though you can add playback speed also with `s=` up to `2`.
Simple as that, create as many "Youtube Gifs" and begin to visualize some ideas.

# HOW TO SET IT UP
`Disclaimer` It's crucial that you have installed `roam42` https://roamjs.com/extensions/roam42

## How & where
### CSS
Under the `roam/css` page or a block with the component `{{{[[roam/css]]}}}`, in both cases, the CSS will live inside a ```css ``` code block.

### JS
Under a block with the component `{{{[[roam/js]]}}}`, the javascript code will live inside a ```javascript ``` code block.
